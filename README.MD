# AMOUNT OF MONEY	


Fed targets the amount of money needed and institutes a corresponding policy to inject it into the economy.

Obviously, paper bills and metal coins are money. Savings accounts and checking accounts represent direct and liquid money balances. 
Money market funds, short-term notes, and other reserves are also often counted. 
Nevertheless, the Fed can only estimate the money supply


# How the Fed Increases the Money Supply

The Fed  buys or borrows Treasury bills from commercial banks to inject money. The central bank will add cash to the accounts, called bank reserves, that banks are required to keep. That increases the money supply. 

On the other hand, if the Fed sells or lends treasuries to banks, the payment it receives in exchange will reduce the money supply.
This is because treasuries are bills of debt to Fed, usually bought from Fed by banks and other financial institutions like Super institutions.

Today's Federal Reserve buys new, readily liquefiable accounts, such as Treasuries, on the open market from financial institutions to add funds to their existing bank reserves. This has the same effect as printing new bills and transporting them to the banks' vaults (but it's cheaper). The newly credited balances count just as much as physical bills in the economy. They can also be just as inflationary.


### Reserve ratio 

As of January 2025, Australia's bank liquid reserves to bank assets ratio was 11.94%.
Banks rely on a fractional reserve banking system whereby banks can lend more than the number of actual deposits on hand.
This leads to a money multiplier effect. If, for example, the amount of reserves held by a bank is 10%, then loans can multiply money by up to 10x.

**Exsample**

To loan customer $750 000 bank needs to have $89,550 in reserve.
If banks profit margin for a mortgage is 1.25% it gets $9.375.00 from the customer per year. As bank uses $89,550 of it's own money (capital) it's yearly return to capital is 10.4%. Not bad...

Mortgages are money!

## Understanding the Federal Funds Rate

It's the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans of excess reserves.
Note that ultimately, Fed defines the rate: When Fed lowers it's interest rates, banks follow suit and lower the rates, like overnight loans and other rates  they charge on products such as consumer loans and credit cards.
